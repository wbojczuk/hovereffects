<h2>usage</h2>
Effects that require text can be given the text through data attributes, this process is done for images as well.<br>
Here is a real exakple pulled from the demo page:<br>
    https://github.com/wbojczuk/hovereffects/blob/5af2da410067849180d5a1c6b7f0c57313610a73/index.html#L39

    <br>
    the code for fade-left/right/up/down for elements onload is also in the JS file. Isn't extremely relevant but I wanted it in my demo so.
